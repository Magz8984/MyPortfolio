         <p>
            I am able to create <b>mobile apps ,desktop apps and Spark enterprise APIs  </b> (application programming interfaces) 
            all using java . My journey in java started in 2017 , at the time java 8 had a big impact on the java
            ecosystem. So all along my code has been centered around java 8 syntax though still interested
            in the evolution of java . I understand OOP programming 
            pradigms such as  <b>SOLID</b> in the context of java.

         <h4 style="text-align:center">C programmer</h4>
         <p>
           As much as i have object oriented skills under my sleeve I like structural 
           programming methodologies, as a result i learned C  and currently using it in 
           embedded systems programming. I must admit I feel at home deconstructing the abstraction 
           level created by most high level languages when allocating and deallocating memory blocks to 
           my programs. Still brushing on my c skills as you can see in my  <a href="https://github.com/Magz8984">github account</a>

        <p>
          In an attempt to  study a different software design paradgim language ,
          i resulted in learning python though i have not worked with popular frameworks 
          yet . I tried building a snake game once and understood some basic concepts 
          in  python.

        <h4 style="text-align:center">Angular</h4>
        <p>
          I learnt angular 6 in order to build single page applications that provdie a user friendly
          environment. While learning angular, I had a chance to tinker with a host of programming languages such 
          as javascript and typescript. Example of projects i have built in angular were a the Git Search , Ordering 
          System to even this portfolio.

        <h4 style="text-align:center">Visual Basic .NET</h4>
        <p>
            I have been able to create managment  systems from point of sales systems,
             church managment systems to transport management systems using vb.net and 
            database management systems such as mysql and microsoft sql server
            not forgetting initial rbms systems such as ms-access. I took a course on this
            at the Institute Of Advanced Technology .

        <h4 style="text-align:center">Jquery</h4>
        <p>
            I have interected ,built and even created content on jquery on youtube.
            I use jquery to create dynamic websites providing a way to interact with
            DOM objects with less code and maximum efficiency that is geared towards 
            code mobility and reusability.

        <h4 style="text-align:center">Android</h4>
        <p>
            I am currently taking android as my operating system of choice to create mobile
            systems both for enterprise and hobby projects. Some of the projects I have done are
            agriculture, marketing and drone projects and  all  are in my gitub account.

        <img src="assets/spark.png" alt="Spark" class="language"> <br>
        <h4 style="text-align:center">Spark</h4>
        <p>
            I build backend services based on java using the spark framework that utilizes the
            MVC software design approach. Services include API's consumed by frontend engineers an microservices
            that rely on a  DBMS such as Postgresql/MySQL. The realtime hotel ordering system is an Example.

        <h4 style="text-align:center">Firebase</h4>
        <p>
          Having applications that require a realtime source of data, scaling with user base
          growth is not only costly but also time consuming when using private servers and
          conventional tools. I resulted in learning Firebase, a Google Cloud tool that
          entails services such as <b>MLKit, RealtimeDB, Cloud Functions, Hosting and Analytics</b>
          to build efficient and cost friendly services that scale with need.

        <p>
            In regards to dynamic websites I can create really amaizing projects
            in html css and javascript both for enterprise and hobby projects.

            Making websites responsive and have a consistent design is one of the
            many things I appreciate doing
